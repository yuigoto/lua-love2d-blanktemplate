YX : Lua : Löve2D Blank Template
================================

> This is just a blank template for me to use when making games in Lua using LÖVE2D.

It's just the `main.lua` and `conf.lua` with callbacks and options I believe I might use frequently, so I put them here and kinda documented, so I'll remember things easily, if I stop using this for some time and begin again. :wink:

There's also this `README` and the `LICENSE` files, which you may change according to your needs.

**IMPORTANT:** the code and comments don't follow any standard for documentation, I just did what felt comfortable to me.

## Dependencies

- `Löve2D` _v0.10.2_;

## Authors

- **Fabio Y. Goto** ([lab@yuiti.com.br][mailto01])

## License

This project is licensed under the `MIT License`, but you can change that, since it's just a blank template. Please check the `LICENSE.md` file for more details.
